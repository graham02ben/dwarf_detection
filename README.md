# dwarf_detection
#For an inputed RA and dec, this code locates significant overdensities in stellar, galactic, and in both maps. In addition uses images to add another source of confidence.
#The code will produce CMDs for all overdensities which match a certain criteria
#By inputting coordinates of chosen overdensity, one can run a MCMC to retrieve data from the overdensity.
#Code outputs: CMD comapred to a field, radial profile, MCMC corner plot, location of local area and zoomed in density map.
